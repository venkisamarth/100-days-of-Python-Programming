# what is function in python
#function is a organised block of reusable code  
# function can be called any number of times 
# Function contaion a set of instruction whcih perforem specific test  example addtion in above example 
# Bank application 
# withdraw credit take_loan link_with
# other resons of using function: 

# Testing and Debugging :- 
# function make it easier to test and debug spcefic  parts of your code

# you can isolate and focus on  individual funtion without  dealing with the entire program's complexity 
# In testing we can debug programs's  complexity 

# In testinf we can debug individual components

#  Improved readabality 
# Effecient code managment 
# functional programming provieds concepts like recursion higher order functions decorators whcih are helfucl for solving complex problems programming
   

# there are tow types of function 
# built in fucntion  and user define function
