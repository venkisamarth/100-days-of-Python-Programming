# # python oct(),hex(),bin() python 
# # inbuilt function for integers conversion 
# bin()
# oct()
# hex()
# # inter -conversion among integers
# # A number prefix ob/oB is considerd as binary 
# # a number with prefix Oo/OO is considerd as octale
# # A number with prefix Ox/Ox os considerd as hexadecimal 

# Built in function for inter-conversion 
# bin()
# oct()
# hex()
# int()

# bin()
# syntax 
# bin(num)

# we can also pass hexadecimal  is to calculated 
# octal number in it 

# num=5 
# print("binary of 5 is:",bin(num))

# print(type(bin(num)))

# print(bin(23))
# print(bin(232))
# oct()

# converts and returns octal string equivalent to passed integers
# syntax 
# oct(num) number whose hexadecimal is to be calculated 

# hex() 
# converts and returns  hexadecimal string equivalent to passed integers
# syntax 
# # hex()
# num=5
# print(oct)
# g=(oct(num))
# print(type(g))

# hexadecimal
