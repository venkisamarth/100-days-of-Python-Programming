#Data types in python 
#Two check data type of the  function 
#type() funciton 
#isinstance() function 


#data type is the just the catogory of data  
#it defines  possible operation:- 10,'shantanu'
 # below are datatypes available in python 

#-numeric types:- int, float , complex (special type)
# sequnce types :- str,list ,tuple 
# there is no array opetion in python list will work as array in the arrya  that could be the 
#using exsternal modul we can create an arrya in the python this could be the normal the it could be the progrmming 
#array module numpy array 
# maping type colliectio of key VALUE PARIS 
# BOOLEAN TYPE  bool 

# Binarly type:- Nonetype 
# range type in 
#binary type  in python  :-bytes, bytearray

# settype in python :-set frozenset
age=23
print(type(23))
print(type(age))
#rvry data type has its own class this is the normal then it could be the normal the it sould be
name="h"
print(type(name))

# there is nor char  data type in  python there is only str data type in python 
# but in c  and C++ in this is the normal the it could be the normal in python 
age=[23,23,34,43,12,23]
print(type(age))
my_tupe=(1,2,3,4,4,"venki",4)
print(type(my_tupe))


#isinstance is used to conferm whter it is whcih data type in python 
print(isinstance(1,int))
print(age,float)

result =isinstance(age,int)
print(result)
