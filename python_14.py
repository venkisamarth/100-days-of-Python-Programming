# Operations in python  give me the example of the operations in python 
# Operaters :- Symbole to carry   out operations on operands (values or data)
# example 3-3
# - us an operators 
# 3,3 are operand 
# # add is the magic method in the python that could help in thee python 
# # add the two numbers give me the  
# # Below are Operators in python : -
# -Arithmetic Operators 
# -Comparision operators 
# - Assignment and compound operators 
# - Bitwise opertors 
# -Logical Operators 


# Arithmetic Opeators 
# additon 
# substraction
# mulitplication 
# division 
# % remainder 
#  floor division 
#  floor division 
# ** exponetiation
# 2 and 3 
# print(2+3)
# print(print(2-3 ))
# print(2*3)
# print(2/3)# always returns the flaot  value 
# print(3**3)
# print(4//3)
# # Below are operators in python 
# # Arithmetic Operatoes 
# # -comparison operators 
# # -Assignment and compund operators 
# # - Bitwise Operators 
# # - Logical Operators 
 

# # # speical  Operators 
# # identity Operators 

# # Walrus Operators 

# # Arithmetic Operators 
# # used to perform a arithemetic operations on two or more operators 

# # Below are  arithemetic Operators 
# # + addition 
# # _ subtraction 
# # * multiplication 
# # % remainder 
# # // floor division 
# # ** expnetiation 
# # using variable 
# num1=2 
# num2=3
# print(num1+num2)

# print(num1%num2)

# # floar division  in python 

# # normal divison 
# print(num1/num2)


# # exponationation 
# num1=2 
# num2=3 
# print(num1+num2)

# print(num1**num2)

# Comparision operators 
# Comparision Operators: -
# comparison values on either side of th and decide relation among them 
# -return boolean value (True  are false )

# 1 greater than (>) 
# 2 less  than (<) 
# 3 equal to (==)
# 4 not equal to(!=)
# 5 reater thatn or equal (>=)
# 6 less than or equal 

a=10
b=4
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a==b)
print(a!=b)
print(a>=b)
print(a<=b)
print(a<b)
# print(a!<=b)

# assignment Operators(=):-
# Operators use dto assign result of right expression /python object to left variable 

# left avaraible .

# syntax varaible =expression /python object 
# ex.num=100

# compound Operators :-
# -combination of other operators and assignment operators 
# assignment  Operators

# notation:- op= 

# ex. 
# a+10 is same as a=a+10

a=10
print(a)
a=a+10
print(a)
a-=10
print(a)

a*=10
