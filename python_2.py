#what is python 
#python is a high level  prgramming language like c and c++
# python is a simple , high level, interprited ,general, purpose,dynamically typed and object oriented 
# programming  language created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991


# python is simple :-
# -python us easy to use 
# -python program are simple to write and hence it is easy to learn 
# -lots of built-in modules . pakages and Frameworks

# in java we have to create a class to print the hello world  on disply 
# like hello world in java 

# class HeloWorld{
#     static public  void main(string args[]){
#         System.out.printlin("Hello world ");
#     }


# in c++ // hello world program  

# #include<iostream.h>
# main(){
#     cout <<"Hello world! <<endl";
#     return 0;
# }
# but in python
# Hello world in python 
# print("hello world")

# python combaines remarkable power with very clean simple and compact syntax 


# python is a high level lanuage 
#More user-friendly 
# There is automatic memory  managment 
#Rich set of libraries and function ex. len(x)
# 



# python is interproted language:- 
#Final execution of python program is down by interpreter 
#interpreter scan the python  program line by line


#python is the general python program language 
#pytho is used for web development machine learning artificial intelligence data analysis data science , web scrapping scripting scientific computing softewar dev etc 
# python is dynamicaly typed language 
# Like c or c++ we don't need to specify datatype of identifiers 
# python eveluated datatype at runtime


# python is object oriented program language 
# python supported nearly all concepts of object oriented style 


# python is a simple, high level interproted general purpose  dynamical typed and object oriented  program language created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.
